    "In the restaurant recommender system, we would like to know :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Geoographical coordinates (latitide and longitude) to find exactly where it is located.\n",
    "2. Population in the neighborhood where the restaurant is located to know if it is usually crowded or not.\n",
    "3. Average income of neighborhood to know how much would be the price range of food in the restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a closer look at each of these :\n",
    "\n",
    "To access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population of a neighborhood is very important factor in determining a restaurant's growth and amount of customers who turn up to eat. Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant. More customers ensures more rating count and this helps in getting a better idea about the restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Income of a neighborhood is also an important factor. Spending of money on food and other needs is usually in proportion to the income."
